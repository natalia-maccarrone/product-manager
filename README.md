# Product Manager

This is a small full-stack application for managing restaurant products. It is a simplified version of a real project, it includes a frontend built with React/TypeScript and a backend API built with Node.js.

## Instructions

Complete the following tasks in any way that you wish. You can change the frontend, the backend, or bothâ€”whatever you think is best.

Refer to the README files in the respective frontend/backend directories for details on how to run each app.

## Features and bug fixes Implemented

1. **Search Product Names with Special Characters**

   - Users can now search for products that include special characters like periods (`.`) or parentheses (`(`, `)`) in their names.

2. **Prevent Deletion of "Available" Products**

   - Products marked as "available" can no longer be deleted.

3. **Confirmation for Deleting a Product**

   - Added a confirmation dialog ("Are you sure?") when a user attempts to delete a product.

4. **Unit Tests**

   - Unit tests have been added where appropriate both in frontend and backend projects.

5. **Additional Improvements**
   - Various enhancements have been made to improve user experience, code quality, and app styling.

## Running Tests

To run the tests for both the frontend and backend, execute the following command in each folder:

```bash
npm run test
```
