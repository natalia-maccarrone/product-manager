# Product Manager Coding Task  

Your task is to analyze, understand, and update the provided demo app.  

The demo app is a simplified version of a feature in one of our real-life projects, and the tasks below are adapted from real requests we've received from our clients. This is a small full-stack application for managing restaurant products. Like our real project, it includes a frontend built with React/TypeScript and a backend API built with Node.js.  

Hopefully, the task will be a bit of fun—there is no single perfect answer!  

We would suggest spending a few hours on the task, although more or less time can be spent as you feel is appropriate. This is not a speed test, so neither will be held against you!  

## Instructions  

Complete the following tasks in any way that you wish. You can change the frontend, the backend, or both—whatever you think is best.  

Update the code to:  

1. Allow the user to search for products that include `.` (dot) or `(` `)` (parentheses/round bracket) characters in their names.  
2. Prevent the user from deleting a product that is "available"  
3. Add an "Are you sure?" confirmation when the user attempts to delete a product.  
4. Add some unit tests where appropriate.  
5. Optional: Make any other changes that you think could improve the user experience, code quality, or app style (feel free to show off!)

Please add comments to explain any updates you make or areas where you want to add more information.  

Refer to the README files in the respective frontend/backend directories for details on how to run each app.  

## What we are looking for  

* How you approach resolving bugs in an existing codebase.  
* How you plan and implement new features without impacting existing functionality.  
* Clean, readable, and maintainable code.  
* Bonus points for strong unit tests and additional comments/documentation.  

You can provide your changes to us via a GitHub link (just make sure the repo is publicly available) or, if you prefer, you can deliver the updated code packaged as a `.zip`.  

Good luck, and thank you for your time and effort!
